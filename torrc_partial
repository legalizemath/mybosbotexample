# DO NOT COPY EVERYTHING, IT WILL LIKELY BE DIFFERENT FOR YOUR INSTALL
# JUST ADD/REMOVE SETTINGS YOU WANT WITHOUT CHANGING YOUR PORT'S NUMBERS

# UNSURE WHAT HELPS WHAT DOESNT YET, NEED LND DEV TO COMMENT

# For umbrel to edit would be something like: nano ~/umbrel/tor/torrc-proxy
# make backups, it will be wiped on updates likely
# make backups, have to restart node to apply settings (sudo ~/umbrel/scripts/stop && sudo ~/umbrel/scripts/start)

# Reference settings manual: https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en
# also lnd.conf tor.streamisolation=1 for now sucks resulting in insane # of disconnects and should not be part of lnd.conf

# SafeLogging 0 # uncomment to show urls/ips in log files

# local ip will be different for different setups, here was umbrel docker setup, can be 0.0.0.0

LearnCircuitBuildTimeout 1      # default: 1      learn timeout over time
CircuitBuildTimeout 124         # default: 60     how long to try building of a circuit or give up 
CircuitStreamTimeout 122        # default: 0      how long until we try a new circuit if connection sucks
NewCircuitPeriod 61             # default: 30     how often to consider making new circuits
MaxCircuitDirtiness 14400       # default: 600    caps how long circuit used for, from last time used if KeepAliveIsolateSOCKSAuth, otherwise from first
MaxClientCircuitsPending 256    # default: 32     higher makes your onion hidden services easier to reach
KeepalivePeriod 63              # default: 300    how often data sent to keep connection awake
